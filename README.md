***MoLuDock Molecular Viewer - README***
Welcome to the MoLuDock Molecular Viewer, an intuitive and interactive tool for visualizing molecular structures using PDB files. This project utilizes the JSmol library to render and manipulate molecular data in a web-based environment.

**Features**
Interactive Molecular Visualization: Rotate, zoom, and explore molecular structures in detail.
Multiple Representation Styles:
Cartoon: Simplified view highlighting protein structure.
Ball and Stick: Atomic-level detailed view.
Dynamic File Upload: Load your molecular structures via .pdb files.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Bootstrap for an accessible and responsive design.
**Installation and Usage**
